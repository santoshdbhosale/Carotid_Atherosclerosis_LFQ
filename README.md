# Carotid_Atherosclerosis_LFQ

## Label-free quantitative proteomics analyses were made for unique serum samples collected as part of a Finnish study of childhood lifestyle and cardiovascular risk. The comparison was made between subjects in whom ultrasound examination had identified plaque formation in the carotid artery, with controls matched by age, gender, body weight and systolic blood pressure (n = 43 vs. 43). To gain an overview of lower abundant proteins, analyses were made of the samples with depletion of the abundant proteins.
